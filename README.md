This repository is to used to share sample codes and public data used in the manuscript "The Impact of Social Distancing and Masking on COVID-19 Spread and Consumer Spending".

The "Data" directory contains cleaned data for estimation and corresponding data dictionary. Please note that we cannot release the social distancing index per the NDA with SafeGraph. But Safegraph provides those social distancing data for academic research on COVID-19 free of charge after researchers sign the NDA (https://www.safegraph.com/covid-19-data-consortium).

The "Code" directory contains code for data cleaning and estimation.

The "Additional Results" directory contains details about the construction of the social distancing index and first stage regression results of the three models presented in the paper.
